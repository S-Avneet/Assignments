## About the company

<br />

### The company which I am discussing in this case study is Cred. This company was founded in 2018, in Silicon Valley of India, Bangaluru, by Kunal Shah. It is his second venture. Earlier he had founded a company in alliance that catered to Indian masses with its financial services that allowed users to pay bills such as electricity, gas and telephone, as well as recharge mobile, broadband, DTH and metro cards. In addition, it enabled users to invest in mutual funds and get credit through Freecharge EMI. (1)

<br />

### Cred initially began as a members-only club that rewarded individuals for their timely credit card bill payments by providing them with exclusive offers and access to premium experiences. Gradually, the company started to expand its reach in the financial services by providing its users short-term credit lines, rent payment services, eCommerce marketplace. The easy and seamless transition from rewards driven platform to getting in the lending market intrigued my interest.

<br />

### The company is almost 5 years old, and has been consistently growing and garnering investments, and has raised a total of $801.5M in about 9 rounds of funding. With their latest investment this year from companies like GIC Singapore, Tiger Global Management and others. (1)

<br />

## Business Overview

<br />

### Initially, the focus of Cred was to help make credit card bill payments easier and to offer the users rewards upon timely payments. Slowly, once they made their presence and gathered a huge amount of customer base, they introduced rent pay option, lending from banks and peer to peer lending, making it a full financial service platform. 

<br />

### From the very beginning, the owner of the company wanted to serve the tax payers of the country and wanted to excel the practice of people getting rewarded for the timely payments. Kunal Shah, in one of his interviews mentioned that he wanted to grow a culture of trust amongst people where the advantages of frictionless environment can bear fruits for the those who have been responsible, dependable and respectable individuals.

<br />

### User base that Cred has under their blanket is more than 7.5 M users, which was last reported in 2021. There are no direct competitors to Cred, however, being a part of the FinTech environment all the players are rooting to garner more customer base. Cred, based on its business model targeted a more financially sound audience, which no other company was seen practicing. Focusing on the niche section of the market provided leverage to Cred to introduce lending options in the platform which otherwise is done by core financial organizations till now. And that strong base of clientele gives a firm grip to the organization to experiment with different financial products before they are, potentially, introduced to the larger audience.

<br />

### Cred uses many different technologies ranging from coding softwares to database management tools, devOps, and many more.

## Future of Lending

<br />

### Owner of the Cred began the company as a reward-based credit card payments app. Kunal Shah, the founder of the company, believed that Cred is not a FinTech company but a TrustTech company, trying to solve the trust issues in Indian society. But with its transition and growth with time, the company has introduced products like Cred Stash, lending low-interest instant credit line and Cred Mint, peer-to-peer lending which are broadly categorizing them under the Lending domain of FinTech.

### Tala, Avant, LendingClub, SoFi, and many other companies are major players in Lending domain.

## Companies Stance in the Market

<br />

### The company processes about 20% of all credit card bill payments through its platform. It has engaged India's most affluent people. Cred doesn't just provide rewards to its users, but it also keeps and maintains a huge data which they monetize and that can help in resolving the future financial problems.

<br />

### For any lending company, the most important metrics to assess the success are:
### -	How quickly the loans are processed
### -	And how efficiently loans are processed by an individual
### With FinTech solutions at hand, this job is mostly done by the computers and programs, in short AI is at play that can help process loans quickly. Having said that, Cred has not provided any such data which could help us determine the metrices that it follows. 

<br />

### Although, the company is generating revenue, but overall, the company's Net Income is down in negative. Even with losses, the company still has gained fundings from major investors. And in the latest investment series, Cred received $80M.

## Prospects for Future

### The company is already advancing, as they are utilizing the opportunities at hand and entering in the lending market space. One product that I believe Cred should work on and introduce is Buy Now Pay Later model. This model of lending has high potential and will attract the consumers to register on the platform in large volumes. 

<br />

### The consumer market has seen an exponential growth in the past few years allowing consumers to have the intended purchasing power. But during the pandemic that was not exactly what consumers experienced. With tight pockets and limited expenditure, many limited their purchases. Buy Now Pay Later model saw a significant rise then which allowed consumers to go back to the usual spendings. Why Cred should introduce this model as a product is because they have a niche market space which already consists of consumers who are trust worthy. And if they start utilizing this product, the potential of defaulting the payments and negative credit impacts would be way under control.

<br />

### With the fast pace at which the consumer lending is being processed, technology like blockchain would come in handy. It can solve many aspects like time in processing the application, validation of data, quick and easy way to keep a track of all the transactions, and more. 

<br />

### These technologies are crucial because they helps with faster processing, they make the platforms more secure and they possess the power to withstand and shape the future of finance.
